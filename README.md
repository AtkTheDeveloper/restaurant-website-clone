# Restaurant Website Clone
This is a practice restaurant website I made as a clone of someone's project website.

## Overview
This is site was made with plain HTML and CSS. No JavaScript. I used Flexbox for the alignment.
No Grid. <strong>"Some links on the entire page do not go anywhere."</strong>
